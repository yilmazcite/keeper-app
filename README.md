# Keeper App

<li>This is the very first project I have completed while learning React.</li>
<li>My motive was to practise and improve my skills on some of the basics of React.</li>
<li>It's a simple note keeper app that enables the user to type in a note and delete the existing notes.</li><br>
<b>A live demo of the project is at</b> <a href="https://yilmazcite.github.io/keeper-app/" target="_blank">https://yilmazcite.github.io/keeper-app/</a>.
